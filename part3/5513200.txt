I wanted to create a calming and engaging sketch based on Lieberman’s iterative coding approach. From previous work, I realized I can achieve a calming mood by keeping a steady rhythm.   

Randomness plays a big role in creating rhythm: the position, color, and movement of the rectangles are all randomly assigned. This randomness is kept in check by isolating movement to the vertical direction — rectangles either move up or down. This allows the viewer to focus either on things moving down, or things moving up, and the colors at the intersections of the rectangles.
