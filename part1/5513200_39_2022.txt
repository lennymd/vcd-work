Compared to the other images in my selection, Raoul Dufy’s “The Red Orchestra” appears to lack the restraint of color present in Bellini’s portrait and the life-like quality. The vibrant large red “blob” pulls your eye directly to itself, away from any other part of the painting. If you can get away from the blob, the view is unusual: watching an orchestra from behind all the players. Figures, instruments, and objects are drawn quickly and plainly, as if in a hurry. By working with a rushed line style, Dufy ensures our focus returns to the color.
The red blob appears to grow from the orchestra, starting from the floor around the players and growing up into the chandeliers and potentially deep into the audience. Being connected to the main chandelier, it appears to represent the amount of light in the hall. But in the background the color is present far from the chandelier, in a more relaxed tone. Thus, it’s not intentionally the light in the hall. Instead of being the intensity of light, it’s the energy or vibrancy of the music being played. It grows from where the players sit making music up and out into the audience. Red is a color associated with danger, passion, and intensity. In this image, the red blob is a visual manifestation of the passion and intensity in the music being played by the orchestra.
From the angle of data visualization, the image is an infographic displaying Dufy’s interpretation of the quality of the music: passionate, intense and overflowing. It reminds me of SOSO Limited’s Colorspace project in Boston: an interactive light sculpture that changes when it receives text messages; text is turned into light. In both cases transforming information from one context to another opens possibilities for visual pleasure.
