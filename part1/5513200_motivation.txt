Leaning on my background in photography, I chose four images highlighting interesting ways to be expressive with color, light, and composition. Bellini’s portrait shows great richness and restraint with respect to color and light, while Dufy’s piece highlights the expressiveness of color. In Cambiaso’s sketch, the elliptical composition centers the viewer in the chaos of the fight. Lieberman’s piece is separate from the previous three: it creates an interesting visual based on the intersection of different digital colors, without a focus on composition or lighting.
