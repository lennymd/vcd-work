I chose Zach Lieberman’s work because I admire his practice of daily sketches that he started in 2016. This image is different from the rest of my selection because it is made exclusively with code. Zach works with the C++ tool OpenFrameworks (that he helped developed) and incorporates randomness and time into his daily sketches; one core aspect of his daily sketches is his desire to always be iterating. While he may look at the same idea, in this case color gradient cones, he experiments with how they're embodied, and in some cases remixes the concept into something new (see reference image 1). Some of his works are static (like this image) and others are animated clips of a concept. 

The image is composed of multiple gradient cones on a black background. As different cones intersect and overlap, their colors mix, creating new colors based on how many cones are mixing. Because he is working with code on a screen, Zach has access to a broader range of colors than what would be available to other artists I have picked like Bellini, Dufy, or Cambiaso. This is interesting because it allows for more room to experiment, iterate, and create visually powerful images.

While the mixture of colors is interesting, I find the positioning of the cones distracting. They appear to be randomly generated around the vertical axis of the work, resulting in a lack of focus or starting point for the image. This lack of focus makes the otherwise technically interesting image feel incomplete. I prefer the variations in reference image 1. I wonder now and would like to test if this lack of focus is perceived by others, or if it’s something uniquely related to me.
