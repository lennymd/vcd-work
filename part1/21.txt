When compared to Bellini’s “Portrait of Fra Teodoro of Urbino as St. Dominic”, Luca Cambiaso’s “Fighting Figures” appears unsophisticated. It lacks the detail, depth of color that make Bellini’s work resonate. The lines are rough in places, the figures inhumanly blocky, and the frame is full to the brim of scenes, but the image feels more energetic than Bellini’s portrait.

In the image, there are many figures in different stages of what could be a multi-person brawl, or a short fight over time. Some figures are wrestling on the floor, another is flipping someone over their shoulder, and some seem to be observing or tumbling through the air. Having so many scenes could be overwhelming, but they are arranged around an ellipse, a composition that helps contain the chaos and guides the viewer’s attention. It provides an opportunity to step between the overwhelming chaos of the image and the individual scenes. 

Another aspect that contributes to the energy in the image is the lack of finish in the figures: they are blocky, removed from how we perceive people. And yet, they feel more life-like than Bellini’s portrait. This sensation comes from not only how active the poses are compared to the portrait, but also from how unresolved the shapes are — descriptive enough to appear human, but not prescriptive enough to force an interpretation. As a viewer, we derive pleasure from filling in the details with our experience. I admire this life-like sensation from the work, and see it mirrored in today’s comics and manga: provided with fragments of a scene, we interpolate a coherent story. Thinking of the work overall, I wonder if the scene is one large brawl, or moments from a fight between the two figures standing in the foreground and background.
