I chose the images primarily based on how flexible their production process was. On one end of the scale, Bellini’s portrait of Fra Teodoro of Urbino as St. Dominic is the least flexible. Working on an oil painting requires a clean plan with little deviation. On the other end of the scale is Zach Lieberman’s work. Code is a malleable medium, and when combined with time and randomness you can generate a large variety of works.
