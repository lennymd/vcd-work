I was initially attracted to Giovani Bellini’s Portrait of Fra Teodoro of Urbino as Saint Dominic because of the depth and richness of colors. The black tunic and cap draw your attention to the face. The dark green curtains with flower patterns work together with the red book to keep you engaged within the portrait — there is nothing behind the curtain or in front of the book that you should focus on. 

Bellini was able to achieve this richness of color through working with oil paints, which allowed more flexibility and control compared to the tempera paints he previously used. With oil paints, Bellini is able to blend colors and create textures that are realistic. For example, looking at the curtain on the right side of the painting with the slight creases, I feel a strong urge to grab it and feel how soft the material is. Such an illusion, a 2D visual that appears 3D, would have been much harder to accomplish with tempera paints.  

While the color and medium are interesting, the lighting in the painting is odd. The halo behind St. Dominic’s head is quite dull even though the halo is a symbol of sanctity. The only source of light in the painting comes from the lily—St.  Dominic’s symbol. This oddness could be explained by the fact that Fra Teodoro is standing in for St. Dominic: Fra Teodoro is not divine so the halo is not bright. On the other hand, one of the symbols of St. Dominic, the lily, is divine and creates its own light.
